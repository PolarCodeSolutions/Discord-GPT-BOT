# PolarCode GPT Discord Bot

A Discord bot that utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to answer questions from users. This bot is designed to assist users by providing helpful responses based on their queries.

## Features

- Responds to user messages starting with the `!ask` command.
- Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 to generate responses.
- Automatically splits long responses into manageable chunks.
- Avoids responding to its own messages and other bots.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or later
- Discord.py library
- OpenAI Python library

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd polarcode-gpt-bot
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv botenv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     botenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source botenv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install discord openai
   ```

5. **Create a `.env` file** (optional, for better security):
   ```
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_token
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

   If you choose to use a `.env` file, you will need to add a package for loading environment variables:
   ```bash
   pip install python-dotenv
   ```

6. **Update your bot script** to load environment variables:
   ```python
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   import os
   
   load_dotenv()
   DISCORD_TOKEN = os.getenv('DISCORD_TOKEN')
   OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
   ```

## Usage

1. **Replace the placeholders** for `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your script with your actual keys. You can find your Discord bot token in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and your OpenAI API key in the [OpenAI Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

2. **Run the bot**:
   ```bash
   python polarcodegpt.py
   ```

3. **Interact with the bot** in your Discord server by sending messages that start with `!ask`. For example:
   ```
   !ask What is the capital of France?
   ```

## Limitations

- The bot is designed to work with text-based messages only.
- Response quality may vary based on the model's understanding of the question.
- Ensure to follow the usage limits of the OpenAI API to avoid potential charges.
